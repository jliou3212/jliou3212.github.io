                    I'm a second-year student at University of Georgia persuing a B.S. in Computer Science. 
                    I currently have an interest in combinatronics as well as data science, and I am actively 
                    looking for opportunities to learn more about these fields.

                <div class="space"></div>
                    For my Software Development course (CS1302), we were asked to make a clone 
                    of a given list of arcade games, and I chose to go with Asteroids. This 
                    game was made in Javafx 8. We used a simple physics engine to handle 
                    collisions.

                    For my Software Development course (CS1302), we were tasked to make a 
                    board game, and I chose to develop chess. This game was made in Javafx 8. 
                    It includes both player vs player, player vs computer, and even computer vs 
                    computer settings. The computer player was made using a simple machine learning 
                    algorithm(minimax) and uses alpha-beta pruning to improve its performance. 
                    The computer player also includes an option for varying difficulty levels.

                <img class="scrot" src="resources/sorting-sim.PNG" alt="Sorting Example"/>
		    I created a sorting simulation application using Javafx to improve my 
		    knowledge on both sorting algorithms and front-end design. I also used 
		    this to teach and explain to peers how different sorting algorithms worked, 
		    their time complexities, and their stability.
